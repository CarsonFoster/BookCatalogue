# Book Catalogue
This is the git repository for my second semester IS project (for senior year).

BookCatalogue is an application that interfaces with a MySQL database to store and retrieve books that the user has read, based on built in characteristics, like author or title, and user-defined tags.

## Planning, Information, and Demonstration

For information on my vision for the project, please look at the document in the [planning](BookCatalogue/planning) directory.

My [project journal](BookCatalogue/planning/Project%20Journal.pdf) details my journey creating BookCatalogue, and the [project presentation](BookCatalogue/planning/Project%20Presentation.pdf) gives an overview of my successes and struggles.

A short demonstration of the project can be found [here (YouTube)](https://youtu.be/AK096jWv7ZQ) and [here (raw file)](BookCatalogue/planning/Demonstration.mp4).
