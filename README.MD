# Book Catalogue
This is the git repository for my second semester IS project (for senior year).

BookCatalogue is an application that interfaces with a MySQL database to store and retrieve books that the user has read, based on built in characteristics, like author or title, and user-defined tags.  
For information on my vision for the project, please look at the document in the "planning" directory.
